# Finstagram

# Project Overview

Finstagram is a web application for sharing photos. It gives users more privacy than many photo sharing sites by giving them more detailed control over who can see which photos they post. The focus of the project is on storing data about who posted which photos and who has permission to view them, tag others in them, see whoâ€™s tagged in what, etc.
Users are able to log in, make, accept or reject follow requests, create and add friends to friendgroups, post photos and designate who can view them, view photos that they have access to and data about these photos (detailed below), as well as take other actions such as tagging, liking, and/or commenting on photos they can view.
